                    <p>Gym Freakz was born from a very simple idea, an idea that I came up with whilst working 9-5, 5 days a week and splitting any available time into researching/investing into the crazy world of NFT’s, going to the Gym, watching sports and spending some quality time with my family. We wanted to create some initially simple art that shows where you ultimately start your Gym experience and what you may want to achieve by spending countless hours on treadmills, busting weights or having someone shouting at you for an hour to “do one more set”!
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>I first caught the NFT bug back in May of this year, purchasing some newly minted projects of 10,000 pieces of auto generated pictures. Although they were auto generated from random traits, the art was pretty cool and I was sold by the wild ideas of gamification and countless amounts of money to be made by their utility usage. Unfortunately they didn’t amount to much as both projects did not sell out and the developers/creators lost interest in a very short space of time, taking home over $1 million dollars per project. That was one of many lessons which I learnt along my journey.
                    
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>My second investment was one of 400 odd pieces of a variation of the original ‘Crypto Punks’, to which I sold at x120 my investment within 4 weeks. There you have it, I was hooked.
                    
                    </p>
                    
                    
                    <p>So taking the first step in planning how to create an NFT project which would grab peoples attention and reward holders both short and long term, I reached out to a developer of vector illustrations through a third party site. So with little budget to employ expensive artists, little budget for marketing and little experience in creating his own set of NFT’s. Me and ‘Developer Dave’ have set out to create something that is unique and something that will capture the attentions of the NFT world and beyond.
                    </p>
                    
                    
                    <p>We want to create a project which will be built on strong community foundations. A community that can benefit in the long run both financially, physically and mentally. We want to blend the physical world with the digital world, buy being one of the only NFT projects that will be creating their own sports/gym brand from some of the money received from the sale of the NFT’s. The brand will be decided by the community from logo to slogan to apparel to accessories with holders being pivotal in the decision making. However that’s not all, see our road map for full details of what our plans are.
