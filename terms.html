                    <p>
                        This website is operated by GYM Freakz. By visiting our site and/or purchasing something from
                        us, you engage in our Service and agree to be bound <br> by the following terms and conditions.
                    </p>
 

                    <p>We reserve the right to update, change or replace any part of these Terms of services without
                        prior written notice at any time, and it is your <br> responsibility to periodically review
                        these Terms of Uses to stay informed of updates.

                    </p> 

                    <p>GYM Freakz is a collection of NFTs (Non Fungible Tokens/digital artworks) running on the Ethereum
                        blockchain. This website is only an interface <br>
                        allowing participants to exchange digital collectibles. Users are responsible for the safety and
                        management of their own Ethereum wallet and <br>
                        validating all transactions and contracts related and generated by GYM Freakz before approval.
                        By using GYM Freakz you are accepting sole <br> responsibility for any and all transactions
                        involving GYM Freakz digital artworks.

                    </p> 
                    <p>You may not use our products and/or services for any illegal or unauthorized purpose nor may you,
                        in the use of the Service, violate any laws in your <br>
                        jurisdiction (including but not limited to copyright laws).
                    </p>


                    <h3>OWNERSHIP</h3>

                    <p>i. The user that is buying and minting our GYM Freakz artwork is the owner of the Non Fungible
                        Token (NFT) crated by validating the transaction. Each GYM Freakz is an NFT on the Ethereum
                        blockchain. When you purchase an NFT, you own all the rights to the underlying GYM Freakz.
                        Ownership of the NFT is mediated entirely and only by the Smart Contract and the Ethereum
                        Network which means that, at no point, may we seize, freeze, or otherwise modify the ownership
                        of any GYM Freakz. ii. Personal Use. Subject to your continued compliance with these Terms, GYM
                        Freakz grants you a worldwide, royalty-free license to use, copy, and display the purchased GYM
                        Freakz(s), along with any extensions that you choose to create or use, solely for the following
                        purposes: (i) for your own personal, non-commercial use; (ii) as part of a marketplace that
                        permits the purchase and sale of your GYM Freakz/NFT, provided that the marketplace
                        cryptographically verifies each GYM Freakz owner’s rights to display the GYM Freakz and ensures
                        that only the actual owner can display the GYM Freakz; or (iii) as part of a third party website
                        or application that permits the inclusion, involvement, or participation of your GYM Freakz,
                        provided that the website/application cryptographically verifies each GYM Freakz owner’s rights
                        to display the GYM Freakz and ensures that only the actual owner can display the GYM Freakz, and
                        provided that the GYM Freakz is no longer visible once the owner of the GYM Freakz leaves the
                        website/application. iii. Commercial Use. Subject to your continued compliance with these Terms,
                        fatapeclub.io grants you an unlimited, worldwide license to use, copy, and display the purchased
                        GYM Freakz for the purpose of creating derivative works based upon the GYM Freakz (“Commercial
                        Use”). Examples of such Commercial Use would be the use of the GYM Freakz to produce and sell
                        merchandise products (T-Shirts etc.) displaying copies of the GYM Freakz. For the sake of
                        clarity, nothing in this Section will be deemed to restrict you from (i) owning or operating a
                        marketplace that permits the use and sale of GYM Freakz generally, provided that the marketplace
                        cryptographically verifies each GYM Freakz owner’s rights to display the GYM Freakz and ensures
                        that only the actual owner can display the GYM Freakz; (ii) owning or operating a third party
                        website or application that permits the inclusion, involvement, or participation of GYM Freakzs
                        generally, provided that the third party website or application cryptographically verifies each
                        GYM Freakz owner’s rights to display the GYM Freakz and ensures that only the actual owner can
                        display the GYM Freakz, and provided that the GYM Freakz is no longer visible once the owner of
                        the Purchased GYM Freakz leaves the website/application; or (iii) earning revenue from any of
                        the foregoing.
